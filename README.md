# OpenStreetMap Vecto

ðŸš§ ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§ ðŸš§

OpenStreetMap Vecto is a general-purpose configuration for [Baremaps](https://github.com/baremaps/baremaps).
It is used to generate vector tiles and to produce a Mapbox style inspired by [OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto).

### Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 18.09+.
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) 1.27+.

## Getting started

In order to experiment with OpenStreetMap Vecto, you first need to clone the current repository

```
git clone git@github.com:baremaps/openstreetmap-vecto.git
cd openstreetmap-vecto/
```

Then, you can start the docker images, import the data, and edit the map with the following commands.

```
docker-compose up --build -d
```

This default environment will:

* Import OSM data of the Liechtenstein
* Import natural earth data (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/)
* import osm water polygon
* import osm simplified water polygons.

You can override this data loaded by modifying the `scripts/import.sh` file.

To override settings. Copy the `env.sample` file to `.env` and modify env var. 


## Docker compose setup

A docker container containing a PostGIS database and all the tools required to run [Baremaps](https://github.com/baremaps/baremaps) can be started with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

The `docker-compose.yml` file contains two services: `db` and `app`. 
The former holding a PostgreSQL 13.1 / PostGIS 3.1 database and the latter serving the applicative content, namely baremaps. 
It's from the `app` containers that you want to run all baremaps commands to populate the database from data, or to start the web application using some of the commands defined hereunder.

The version of baremaps can be changed via the variable `BAREMAPS_VERSION` in the `env.sample` file. To find a specific version of baremaps go to the [github release page](https://github.com/baremaps/baremaps/releases/) of the project.

### Useful commands

Command                                                     | Description
:---------------------------------------                    | :--------------------------------------------------
`docker-compose up --build`                                 | Run the application in the foreground.
`docker-compose up --build --detach`                        | Run the application in the background.
`docker-compose stop`                                       | Stop all containers.
`docker-compose down`                                       | Stop and remove all containers (but keep the data).
`docker-compose down --volumes`                             | Stop and permanently delete all containers and data.
`docker-compose down --volumes --remove-orphans`            | Same as previous and remove all dangling containers not defined in the Compose file.
`docker-compose exec app <command>`                         | Execute a command inside the running `app` container.
`docker-compose exec app bash -c ./scripts/import.sh`       | Execute the import.sh script to populate the database (inside the container).
`docker-compose exec app bash -c ./scripts/edit.sh`         | Edit the map (the db must be populated before running that command).
`docker-compose ps`                                         | List running containers.
`docker-compose logs --tail 20 -f`                          | Print all containers logs to stdout (usefull when they were launched in the background).


Your browser ([http://localhost:9090/](http://localhost:9090/)) should now preview OpenStreetMap Vecto.     
Here, the port is `9090`, but you will have to use the one you defined in your `.env` if you changed it. 
You will also have to change the port and host in `tileset.json` if you don't use the standard ones.    
Notice that a change in the configuration files (`tileset.json`) will automatically be reloaded by the browser.

## Editing the tileset

The configuration format used in the `tileset.json` file extends the [TileJSON specification](https://github.com/mapbox/tilejson-spec/tree/master/2.2.0).
Simply put, it adds in the ability to describe the `vector_tiles` and their content with SQL queries that follow the Postgis dialect.

```
{
  "tilejson": "2.2.0",
  "tiles": [
    "http://localhost:9090/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt"
  ],
  "vector_layers": [
    {
      "id": "aerialway",
      "queries": [
        {
          "minzoom": 14,
          "maxzoom": 20,
          "sql": "SELECT id, tags, geom FROM osm_ways_z${zoom} WHERE tags ? 'aerialway'"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Editing the style

The configuration format used in the `style.json` follows the [Mapbox style specification](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js).
Baremaps integrates [Maputnik](https://maputnik.github.io/) and most of the modifications will take place in the browser.

## Contributing

As a lot remains to be done, contributions and feedbacks are welcome. 

## Troubleshooting windows

On windows, be careful with line endings (LF), especially when the files are mounted in a docker container.

```
docker run -d --name osmvecto --publish 5432:5432 --publish 9090:9090 --volume C:\openstreetmap-vecto:/home baremaps/osmvecto:latest
docker exec -ti osmvecto bash -c ./import.sh https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/switzerland-latest.osm.pbf
```
